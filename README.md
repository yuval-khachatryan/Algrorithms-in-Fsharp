# Algrorithms-in-Fsharp
Implementations of basic data structures and algorithms in F# - An attempt to better understand algorithms. 
Using F# instead of pseudo-code (or python).

This project is created for learning purposes only. 
This is a compnion project to https://github.com/yuval-khachatryan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis-Solutions.

The main goal is to compare F# and C++ side by side - I want to find myself whether F# as a language itself is more productive than C++.
If it is the case I am interested to find out in there is an actual performance penalty. I am also interested to see how F# compares 
to other languages as language to teaching basic computer science.
